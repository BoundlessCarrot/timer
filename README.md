# CLI Timer

This is a really simple timer app that I made just because I didn't have a nice timer on my laptop and my phone was in a different room, charging.

## Usage
You'll have to manually move the ```timer``` exec into your PATH, but once you do, usage is very simple:
```timer -m [# of minutes] -s [# of seconds]```. Both arguments are optional, so you can put in exactly as much time as you need without any fuss. The timer also has a progress bar and will play a sound when the timer is finished. This can be changed/disabled by editing the code and maybe rerolling it into an exec again (temp fix). Comes with 2 different alarm sounds

## To-Do
  - Create config system to make changing settings easy
  - Auto-install bash script to place in PATH

I'll get to both of those when I can, so no guaranteed deadline there.
